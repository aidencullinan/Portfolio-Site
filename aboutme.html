                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Aiden Cullinan, a cybersecurity-focused applied computing student with a strong foundation in software development and networking. My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how systems work and how they can be both built and broken. Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion for protecting digital infrastructure and creating tools that are both functional and secure.</p>
                <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Applied Computing with a focus on Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics at Arizona State University. Alongside my studies, I’ve worked on a range of technical projects, from data-driven apps to vulnerability research, and I continue to sharpen my skills in languages like Java, Python, and C. I created this site not just as a portfolio, but as a space to document my growth, showcase hands-on projects, and reflect on the evolving challenges in tech.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, I plan to build a career at the intersection of software and security, helping organizations stay ahead of threats through proactive design, secure coding, and meaningful innovation. Whether it's through contributing to open-source projects, collaborating on research, or exploring new technologies like AI and blockchain, I'm excited to keep learning and making an impact in the cybersecurity field.</p>
                <p>This portfolio site is organized to reflect both my technical capabilities and ongoing learning. The <a href="index.html">Home</a> page gives a brief introduction and highlights key areas of my work. The <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page—where you are now—offers a deeper look into my background, goals, and values as a developer and cybersecurity student. The <a href="projectslibrary.html">Projects</a> page showcases selected projects that I am working on or have completed, often with video and image demonstrations, explanations, and examples. The <a href="bloglibrary.html">Blog</a> section contains write-ups on topics I’ve explored in-depth intended to both document and share my insights with others. On the <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> page, you’ll find an up-to-date summary of my technical skills, work experience, and education. Finally, the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page includes a form where visitors can reach out for collaboration, feedback, or networking opportunities. Altogether, this site is both a living record of my academic and professional journey and a gateway for others to connect with me.</p>
